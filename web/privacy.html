<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

<h2>What is ebcli?</h2>
<p>ebcli is a personal command-line tool that accesses bank account information (balances and transactions) through the Enable Banking API. It is used for personal financial management only.</p>

<h2>Data collected</h2>
<p>ebcli accesses the following data from your bank via Open Banking APIs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Account identifiers (IBAN, account type)</li>
  <li>Account balances</li>
  <li>Transaction history</li>
</ul>

<h2>How data is processed</h2>
<p>All data is processed locally on your own device. No bank data is transmitted to, stored on, or processed by any external server. The data flows directly from your bank through the Enable Banking API to your local machine.</p>

<h2>Data storage</h2>
<p>Bank data is not persisted. It is fetched on demand and exists only in memory during command execution. Connection metadata (session IDs, account aliases) is stored locally in a configuration file on your device with restricted file permissions.</p>

<h2>Third parties</h2>
<p>ebcli uses the <a href="https://enablebanking.com">Enable Banking</a> API as an aggregation layer to access bank data via PSD2/Open Banking interfaces. No data is shared with any other third party.</p>

<h2>Your rights</h2>
<p>You can revoke access at any time by running <code>ebcli disconnect</code> or by revoking consent through your bank's online banking interface. You can delete all local configuration by removing <code>~/.config/ebcli/</code>.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
